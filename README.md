HomeControl
===========
This project aims to merge together all electronic devices in my home. This makes it possible to set up schedules, and run routines based on time, event or manual triggers.

The code is still very specific to my set up, and assumes alot of details about the computers and which devices are present.

Installation
------------
To make the code run, you will at least have to add a `nodes.hrl` file which defines the nodes of the system.
